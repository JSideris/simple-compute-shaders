# Description

An GPU implementation of the Game of Life, a cellular automaton created by British mathematician John Conway in 1970. It's a zero-player game, meaning the evolution of the system is determined by its initial state, with no further input from the player. Despite its simplicity, the Game of Life can produce incredibly complex and unexpected patterns, demonstrating the power of emergent behavior in computational systems.

This example features a compute pipeline for progressing the simulation, and a rendering pipeline for rendering it.
